# Emotion Detection with Python, OpenCV, and Scikit Learn

This project focuses on building a system to classify human emotions by analyzing facial expressions, using images or video as input.

## Authors

- [Samith Chimminiyan](https://www.github.com/samithcsachi)


## Problem Statement 

Emotion detection is a computer vision and machine learning project using Python libraries to identify and classify human emotions‚Äîsuch as happy, sad, angry, surprised, or neutral‚Äîfrom facial expressions. The workflow includes face detection, feature extraction, and emotion classification using machine learning models.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in images or live video.
- **Feature Extraction:** Processes detected faces to extract relevant features for emotion analysis.
- **Emotion Classification:** Trains and applies machine learning models (Scikit Learn) to classify emotions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes scripts for cleaning and organizing the dataset.
- **Model Training/Evaluation:** Supports model training, evaluation, and testing on new data.
